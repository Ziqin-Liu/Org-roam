Met with [[id:B635106A-C054-4D69-A104-565ACB511F63][PROJECT Sijia Chen]] and discussed identity — a complex problem!

Talked with a faculty member from Psychology during lunch. I really enjoy working in the Psychology department, where I can meet and chat with peers and faculty. The environment here seems quite different from my own department, which feels more isolated — though maybe that’s just my impression.

Attended the first class of Seminars in College Instruction. After class, I had a great conversation with Kevin, whom I met during group therapy last fall semester, when he kindly accompanied me to Arjona.

Swam with [[id:CDB6BBC8-1259-4BAB-A001-C8E9A3CE118C][PEOPLE Mark]]. It was his first swim in the US, and he couldn’t get used to it — the pool was too deep for him to stand alone. After swimming a few feet, he grabbed the lane line to support himself.
Finally, we moved to the shallow area, which was more comfortable.

I came across David J.C. MacKay, who passed away in 2016. Yet, as I browsed his webpage, I felt like he is still alive.
