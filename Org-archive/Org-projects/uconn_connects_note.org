* New Common Curriculum
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The courses fulfilling the Topics of Inquiry must represent at least six different subjects as designated by subject code (e.g., ANTH or WGSS).
Exceptions to this rule are subject heading designations that group interdisciplinary studies through cross-listing, such as LLAS, AFRA, WGSS, AAAS, URBN, ENVS,
EVST, HRTS, UNIV, and INTD. One unique course from interdisciplinary studies through cross-listing can be used towards any single cross-listed unit, but could
not be used to meet more than one subject area in the six expected within the Common Curriculum. (ie AAAS/AFRA/ARTH 2222 could be used towards the subject area
AAAS or AFRA or ARTH. It could not be used to meet 3 different subject areas.)
