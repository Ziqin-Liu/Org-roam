dateset and citation

the number of arcticle indentify

a lot of removing

what kind of measure we want to

task are important for fmri

quality domain

meta-analysis vs systematic review

Problem Formulation

document all changes to the protocol & why

special notes on eligibility criteria
+ publication status
+ studies should not be excluded from a MA/SR just based on sample size/statistical power

the risk of bias
as inclusive as possible

sample size

documenting

slack

team science

A good method to learn is to keep a doc to write all the terms
