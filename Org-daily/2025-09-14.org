The way to avoid burnout is not to ask for help from the external, instead of I should keep me clam and ask what is my goal.

Another good way might be try to keep everything consistent. Therefore I aim to build a healthier lifestyle.

The first important thing is to have great sleep. I aim to sleep before 10 pm and wake up at 5 am.
So I tried to avoid using screen after 9:00pm. I put the phone far away from me, right now I just put it in the school, or put it in another lab, so I have no access to got it.

I believe A good lifestyle help me to achieve my final goal.

The first priority is getting good sleep. My goal is to sleep before 10:00 pm and wake up at 5:00 am. To support this, I avoid using screens after 9:00 pm. I also keep my phone far away—sometimes leaving it at school or in another lab—so I won’t be tempted to use it.

I believe that a healthy lifestyle will help me stay focused and ultimately achieve my goals.
