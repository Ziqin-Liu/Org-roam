I got my bike repaired today in the Storrs Cycle Center which I just stop by. I love this shop which is located on the road to Willimantic, and its neibourhour is a bank. The bicycle repair shops in china that I have been to
are usually dirty, the floor have a layer of oil, a lot of tool in a box without classify. This shop is clean, a lot of expensive bicycle put in order in the floor as well as on the wall. The wall hang on a lot of item, even
the 螺母 has their own place in the wall.

The worker installed the seatpost, replaced the inner tube, and checked the state of bicycle brake, which totally costed me $93, higher then the original cost to get this bick, which only cost me $80



I got my bike repaired today at the Storrs Cycle Center, which I stopped by on a whim. I really love this shop — it’s located on the road to Willimantic, right next to a bank.

Compared to the bike repair shops I’ve been to in China, this one feels very different. Those shops were often dirty, with oily floors and tools piled in boxes without any organization. But this shop is clean, well-organized, and clearly cared for. Expensive bicycles are neatly arranged both on the floor and mounted on the walls.

The walls are lined with all kinds of items — even the nuts and bolts each have their own specific place. It’s a small detail, but it really impressed me.

The technician installed a new seatpost, replaced the inner tube, and checked the condition of the bicycle brakes. The total cost came to $93, which is actually more than what I originally paid for the bike — just $80.
