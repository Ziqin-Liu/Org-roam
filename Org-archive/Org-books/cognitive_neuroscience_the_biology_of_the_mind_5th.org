#+title:BOOK Cognitive Neuroscience The Biology of the Mind 5th
#+filetags:  
* Plan
The book has roughly 650 pages to read. If I want to finish it in one year with two passes, that means I need to read about 4 pages per day. For the first pass, Iâ€™ll aim to read 5 pages per day.

+ Skip the Chapter 1
+ Skip Chapter 2.1 and 2.2
+ Skip 2.7

* Chapter 2
** Overview of Nervous System Structure
*** The Central Nervous System
+ Terminology
  + nucleus
  + layer
  + cerebellum
  + grey matter
  + white matter
  + tracts
  + commissures
*** Blood supply and the Brain
+ Navigating the brain
  + rostral (anterior)
  + caudal (posterior)
  + dorsal (superior)
  + ventral (inferior)

  + sagittal
    + midsagittal
    + lateral sagittal section
    + coronal section
